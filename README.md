This is a comprehensive full-stack hotel booking platform built with the MERN stack. The project is architected as a monorepo containing three separate applications:

1.  **Backend API (`api`)**: A robust Node.js and Express server that powers the entire platform.
2.  **User Client (`client`)**: A user-facing React application for searching, viewing, and booking hotels.
3.  **Admin Panel (`admin`)**: A dedicated React application for administrators to manage users, hotels, and bookings.

The application ensures security through a JWT-based authentication system and provides a rich set of features for users, hotel owners, and administrators.

## Key Features

### User-Facing App (`client`)
* **Complete User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with password hashing and JWT sessions.
* **Advanced Hotel Search**: Search for hotels by destination, dates, and number of guests.
* **Detailed Hotel & Room Views**: Browse hotels, view amenities, and see available rooms with pricing.
* **Seamless Booking System**: Users can select rooms and book them for specific dates, with real-time availability checks.
* **My Bookings Page**: Authenticated users have a personal dashboard to view their reservation history.
* **Property Management**: Allows users to register their own properties, including image uploads, and manage them via their account page.

### Admin Panel (`admin`)
* **Centralized Dashboard**: A dedicated interface for administrators to oversee the platform.
* **User Management**: Ability to view, manage, and potentially suspend user accounts.
* **Hotel Management**: Admins can oversee all hotel listings, verify new submissions, and edit or remove properties.
* **Booking Management**: View and manage all bookings made across the platform.

## Tech Stack

## Folder Structure

The repository is a monorepo containing three top-level directories for each part of the application.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to set up and run all three applications concurrently.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running, or a MongoDB Atlas account.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AwantikaTiwari13/Booking-App.git](https://github.com/AwantikaTiwari13/Booking-App.git)
    cd Booking-App
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (`api`):**
    (Open a terminal in the project root)
    ```sh
    cd api
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `/api` directory and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    ```
    Start the backend server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The API will now be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

3.  **Set up the User Client (`client`):**
    (Open a **new terminal** in the project root)
    ```sh
    cd client
    npm install
    ```
    Start the client development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The user-facing app will be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Set up the Admin Panel (`admin`):**
    (Open a **third terminal** in the project root)
    ```sh
    cd admin
    npm install
    ```
    Start the admin panel development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The admin dashboard will be running on a different port, typically `http://localhost:3000`.
